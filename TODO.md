- Implement role for the validation of owner and founder
- create their specific services as well
- Add admin controllers
- Change controllers like if it is a user that has lost something the lost id gets automatically added as the user id of that person
- If no user then make controllers and dtos in such a way that if that info is not there it should dynamically adapt to it
- Make user inputs generic with the use of interfaces
